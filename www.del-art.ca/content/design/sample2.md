Logo concept design started from the idea of conductor's music desk, or the choir stage setup, taken in decorative or stylized manner.

The work developed through the inclusion of a typo stylization that uses the shape and characterization of letters as the medium of expression conveying the basic strong message, in this case, aimed at highlighting the essence of choral singing 'con amore', from passion.

Finally, the selected version, strongly limited and focused on lettering, refers to the theme of the heart, but also to the music score notation. 
Individual letters rise and fall as recorded on the staff.
The shape of the letters maintains associations with the musical notations: bass clef and also Gregorian chant scripture.

1. For some branding usage, in some cases, the version emphasizing the centrally located heart was in use. 
2. In cases where greater discipline and simpler form are more appropriate or required, secondary elements are omitted.

> Another logo for a choir was done for the next ensemble led by the same conductor.

## Cantabile Choir

In a way, this is a modernized version of the Agnus Dei choir logo. The individual features of typography, and musical references are maintained.

The logo seems simple, yet it maintains a strong character and is a recognizable accent in the choir's promotional materials.
