The revamp of the logo for the CNC workshop. The former logo was selected from the template.

The work on the logo design went in two directions. An attempt to make an already functioning element more attractive and a search for a new motif related to the three-dimensional reference system in the CNC machining technology.

Two main motives are

1. Figuratve sketches exploring the spatial perception,
2. Portrait sketches catching the essence in raw, singular lines.

Some of them were sketches or visuals prepared for stereo anaglyph compositions printed in serigraphy.

### Stereoscopic serigraph print tests

My earliest versions of stereoscopic experiments were photographs taken for the left and the right eye, respectively, and after test on computer screen, printed in serigraph.
